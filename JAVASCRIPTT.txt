   javaScript :- javaScript is a high lavel Client intrepted programming Language which is developed Brendan Eich in 1995.
                 javaScript using three technology's world wide web , HTML ,CSS . 
                 It is using interpeter translater for run program line by line . javaScript is provided to create static webpage into dynamic webpage .



      Dynamic :- dynamic means Things can change while the program is running .           


      Client side :- Those code excute in your device rather than Server .
                     

      JS Engine :- JS engine is a software that execute js code into machine instruction in your device .

   Key characteristics:-
         
         1. Dynamic and Interactive Web Pages:  JavaScript enables the creation of dynamic and interactive elements on web pages that cannot be achieved with HTML and CSS alone. This includes animations, interactive forms, dynamic content updates, and more.

         2. Client-Side Scripting:  Historically, JavaScript was predominantly used as a client-side scripting language, meaning it runs directly within a user's web browser,

         3.  Cross-Platform: JavaScript is a cross-platform language, meaning code written in JavaScript can run on various operating systems and environments, including web browsers, servers, and even mobile applications (with frameworks like React Native).

         4. Interpreted and Just-in-Time Compiled:  JavaScript is typically interpreted, meaning the code is executed line by line by a JavaScript engine (like V8 in Chrome). Modern JavaScript engines also employ just-in-time (JIT) compilation for performance optimization.




    Variables:- It is the container or memory block which can store multiple type of data that is called Variables.

    Variables declare ruls and regulations -
